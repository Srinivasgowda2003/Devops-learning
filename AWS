# AWS Notes

## What is Cloud?
Cloud is on-demand access to servers, networking, storage, and software over the internet.

## Types of Cloud
- **Public Cloud** – cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP  
- **Private Cloud** – your own cloud infrastructure  
- **Hybrid Cloud** – mix of public + private  

## Cloud Service Models
### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
You manage OS, applications.  
Examples: EC2, VPC, EBS, S3

### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
You manage only code.  
Examples: Elastic Beanstalk, RDS (partly), Lambda (FaaS)

### 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
You just use the software, no management needed.  
Examples: Gmail, Salesforce
